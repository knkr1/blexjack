## Features

3. Can handle various scenarios (Such as a player leaving mid game)

## Future Plan

2. Split & Double
3. Community game (Game against other players instead of dealer)
4. Sound effects
5. Camera control
6. Game Effects
7. Save win data
8. Add Bet
9. Idk even more

## Note

I'm the only dev working on this and it's a hobby project, don't expect it to be "good".

Also, I didn't had a chance to make a bug test, so even though the game is working, there could be minor bugs. Most of the time game won't get effected by that.

## Getting Started

You may access to the uncopylocked version of the thing. (If I don't forget it)
